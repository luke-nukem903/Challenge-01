# Challenge-01
 Make the webpage more accessible for screenreaders.
## Description
This code has had all `div` tags replaced with semantic tags i.e. `main` `section`. Proper use of `id` and `class` to better organize. CSS has been edited to remove redundancies and apply `class` and `id` labels.
Added `alt` id's for all images for screenreaders.
